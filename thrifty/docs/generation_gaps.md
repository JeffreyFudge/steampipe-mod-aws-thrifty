## Thrifty Generation Gaps Benchmark

Thrifty developers prefer new generation of cloud resources to deliver better performance and capacity at a lower unit price. For instance by simply upgrading from `gp2` EBS volumes to `gp3` EBS volumes you can save up to 20% on your bills.

The same theme applies to EC2, RDS, and EMR instance types: older instance types should be replaced by latest instance types for better hardware performance. In the case of RDS instances, for example, switching from the M3 generation to M5 can save over 7% on your RDS bill.

Upgrading to the latest generation is often a quick configuration change, with little downtime impact, that yields a nice cost-saving benefit.
